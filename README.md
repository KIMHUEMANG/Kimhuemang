### Hi thereðŸ‘‹

**I wanna be a Front-End Engineer that is the same as Full-Stack Engineer !**  
  
Accumulating new knowledge and endless learning Those are the reasons why I became a developer  
  
My knowledge accumulated one by one will make a successful result in the future. 
  
Also, I think that working well with team members through smooth communication is the most important skill as a developer.
